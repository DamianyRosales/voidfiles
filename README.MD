The config file included in this repository must replace the onw generated by default when i3 is installed, it can be found in the **~/.config/i3/** folder.

Notice that some scripts are runned when i3 is initialized. They are described later on this README, check the table of contents.

This config file is set to run **firefox** as the default web browser, **scrot** binded to the PrintScreen key, etc.

Here are the specific bindings:


```bash
$mod+b exec "firefox"
