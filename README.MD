## fonts <a name="fonts"></a>

Command:
```bash
xbps-install font-firacode font-adobe-source-code-pro font-material-design-icons-ttf font-awesome6 font-awesome
```

1. Fira Code
```bash
xbps-install font-firacode
```
2. Source Code Pro
```bash
xbps-install font-adobe-source-code-pro
```
3. Material Design Icons
```bash
xbps-install font-material-design-icons-ttf
```
4. Font Awesome 6
```bash
xbps-install font-awesome6
```
5. Font Awesome
```bash
xbps-install font-awesome
```


## i3 <a name="i3"></a>

```bash
xbps-install i3-gaps i3blocks i3status
```

The config file included in this repository must replace the onw generated by default when i3 is installed, it can be found in the ```$HOME/.config/i3/``` folder.

Notice that some scripts are runned when i3 is initialized. They are described later on this README, check the table of contents.

This config file is set to run ```firefox``` as the default web browser, ```scrot``` binded to the PrintScreen key, etc.

Here are the specific bindings:


```bash
$mod+b exec "firefox"
$mod+d exec "rofi -show drun"
Print exec "scrot"
```

All gaps (excluding bottom and top) are set to 25 px.
Of course, ```$mod + Enter``` will open default terminal.


## alacritty <a name="alacritty"></a>

```bash
xbps-install alacritty
```

The alacritty.yml file from this repository uses the following fonts: Fira Code and Source Code Pro.
It is prepared with a Gruvbox-Dark theme already and the opacity is set to 0.5 but it will only work once PICOM is installed.
Padding is 15px for both X and Y.

## polybar <a name="polybar"></a>

```bash
xbps-install polybar
```

The polybar included in the config.ini is prepared to work for a eDP1 monitor, in case of any display error, look for proper monitor name and replace it.
In case of battery display problems, replace the variables ```batery``` and ```adapter```. Look for correct battery and adapter using the following command:

```bash
ls -1 /sys/class/power_supply/
```

The bar will work with the fonts previously mentioned in this readme. Only i3 module is pre-configured.

For backlight scrolling, permissions are needed. You can copy the ```backlight.rules``` file into the ```/etc/udev/rules.d/``` folder.

*backlight.rules*
```bash
RUN+="/bin/chgrp wheel /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness"
RUN+="/bin/chmod g+w /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness"
```


# rofi <a name="rofi"></a>

```bash
xbps-install rofi
```

No further settings are needed for ```rofi``` it works out of the box along with i3. Be sure to have the ```config.rasi``` in the proper ```$HOME/.config/rofi/``` folder.


# picom <a name="picom"></a>

For rounded corners and dual_kawase blur on all backends, <a href="https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom">ibhagwan picom fork</a> is needed.

On arch based distros it can be installed from the AUR using your favorite AUR helper such as ```yay```:

```bash
yay -S picom-ibhagwan-git
```

Instructions for building `picom-ibhagwan` on void linux using `xbps-src`:

1. Setup the `void-packages` repo:

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages
cd void-packages
./xbps-src binary-bootstrap
echo XBPS_ALLOW_RESTRICTED=yes >> etc/conf
```

2. Download the template repo and copy into `srcpkgs`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom-ibhagwan-template
mv picom-ibhagwan-template ./srcpkgs/picom-ibhagwan
```

3. Build & install the package:

```sh
./xbps-src pkg picom-ibhagwan
sudo xbps-install --repository=hostdir/binpkgs picom-ibhagwan 
```

**Note #1:** if you have `xtools` installed you can install the package by running `xi -f picom-ibhagwan` (instead of using `xbps-install`).

**Note #2:** before installing the package make sure to remove all other `compton|picom` packages with `sudo xbps-remove picom compton`.

# fish <a name="fish"></a>

```bash
xbps-install fish-shell
```

```fish``` should work out of the box with the config.fish copied into ```$HOME/.config/fish/```.

To switch the default shell, follow the tutorial from the <a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/3.0/tutorial.html#tut_switching_to_fish">official documentation</a>


# miscellaneous <a name="miscellaneous"></a>

### feh <a name="feh"></a>

```bash
xbps-install feh
```

For image viewer, ```feh``` is the perfect package.

Desktop wallpaper can be set to change automatically every 10 minutes (or any number) with the ```auto-wall.sh``` script copied into ```$HOME/.config/```.
It is set to automatically load on i3's startup.

### Tap Gestures and Natural Scrolling <a name="gestures"></a>

For natural scrolling and on-tap gestures on the touchpad, you need the ```xf86-input-libinput``` package.

```bash
xbps-install xf86-input-libinput
```

Also, the ```30-touchpad.conf``` file must be in the ```/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d``` folder.

*30-touchpad.conf*
```bash
Section "Inputclass"
	Identifier "devname"
	Driver "libinput"
	Option "Tapping" "on"
	Option "NaturalScrolling" "true"
EndSection
```


### Caps-lock delay <a name="caps"></a>

The file ```xkbmap``` must be in the ```$HOME/.config/``` folder and it will be loaded on i3's startup.
